                  <h4>About AnyIP</h4>
                  <p>
                    AnyIP is a high-performance proxy and networking infrastructure provider used by developers, marketers, and
                    automation teams to route traffic reliably across the globe. With multiple marketing channels driving
                    acquisition, the team needed clarity on performance, spend efficiency, and the true ROI of their campaigns,
                    but their analytics setup wasn’t giving them the visibility they needed.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <div class="case-detail">
                  <h4>Challenge: No Ownership of Analytics &amp; Limited Visibility Into Marketing Performance</h4>
                  <p>
                    AnyIP needed someone to fully <strong>own their analytics</strong> and help them make sense of their marketing
                    data. The core challenges were:
                  </p>
                  <ul class="list">
                    <li>Data was messy and inconsistent</li>
                    <li>Dashboards lacked structure and clarity</li>
                    <li>The team couldn’t see which channels were performing</li>
                    <li>CAC was difficult to measure accurately</li>
                    <li>Insights were fragmented, slowing down decision-making</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>They needed a clean analytics foundation and clear reporting that could guide day-to-day marketing decisions.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="case-detail">
                  <h4>Solution</h4>
                  <p>We collaborated with the team to build a complete, reliable analytics workflow.</p>

                  <h5>1. Cleaned and structured the raw data</h5>
                  <ul class="list">
                    <li>Identified inconsistencies in existing datasets</li>
                    <li>Cleaned and standardized data fields</li>
                    <li>Streamlined tracking across channels</li>
                    <li>Ensured the data aligned with their business goals</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>This created a trustworthy dataset that could power reliable insights.</p>

                  <h5>2. Built a structured reporting system</h5>
                  <p>We created multiple dashboards focused on:</p>
                  <ul class="list">
                    <li>Channel performance</li>
                    <li>CAC and ROI trends</li>
                    <li>Activation and funnel metrics</li>
                    <li>Campaign-level breakdowns</li>
                    <li>User behaviour insights derived from marketing traffic</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Each dashboard was designed to be easy to understand, even for non-technical team members.</p>

                  <h5>3. Enabled ongoing visibility &amp; decision-making</h5>
                  <p>The dashboards helped the team:</p>
                  <ul class="list">
                    <li>See what’s working and what’s not</li>
                    <li>Allocate budget more effectively</li>
                    <li>Identify high-performing channels</li>
                    <li>Reduce wasted spend</li>
                    <li>Make faster data-driven decisions</li>
                  </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="case-detail">
                  <h4>Result</h4>
                  <p>The team now actively uses these dashboards to optimize their marketing operations. As a result:</p>
                  <ul class="list">
                    <li>Marketing performance improved across channels</li>
                    <li>CAC decreased as spend became more efficient</li>
                    <li>Decisions are now grounded in data, not assumptions</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    AnyIP now operates with a clear, structured view of their marketing funnel, enabling them to scale with
                    confidence.
