                <h4>Challenge: Overtracking &amp; Inconsistent Event Structure Led to Data Chaos</h4>
                <p>
                  The Wellness Coach team had implemented tracking extensively, in fact, almost <strong>every single click</strong> and
                  action was being logged. However:
                </p>
                <ul class="list">
                  <li>Event names were inconsistent</li>
                  <li>The structure lacked hierarchy</li>
                  <li>Properties varied unpredictably across events</li>
                  <li>Tracking had grown organically without governance</li>
                </ul>
                <p>With <strong>millions of events flowing in</strong>, this resulted in:</p>
                <ul class="list">
                  <li>Confusion across product and analytics teams</li>
                  <li>Data discrepancies between dashboards</li>
                  <li>A lack of trust in the numbers</li>
                  <li>Difficulty answering even simple behavioural questions</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The company needed a clean, scalable analytics foundation.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="case-detail">
                <h4>Solution</h4>
                <p>To restore clarity and trust, I conducted a comprehensive analytics audit and rebuilt their event taxonomy.</p>
                <p><strong>1. Full audit of the existing setup</strong></p>
                <p>I reviewed:</p>
                <ul class="list">
                  <li>Event names and patterns</li>
                  <li>Property structures and inconsistencies</li>
                  <li>Redundant or duplicated events</li>
                  <li>Gaps in measuring core workflows</li>
                  <li>Misaligned definitions across teams</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This helped identify what was useful, what was unnecessary, and what was missing.</p>

                <p><strong>2. Created a clean, simplified event taxonomy</strong></p>
                <p>The new analytics structure included:</p>
                <ul class="list">
                  <li><strong>Clear event naming conventions</strong></li>
                  <li><strong>Categorized events based on user journeys</strong> (onboarding, sessions, habits, content consumption, etc.)</li>
                  <li><strong>Consistent property schemas</strong></li>
                  <li><strong>Removal of noisy, click-based events</strong> that offered no strategic value</li>
                  <li>A blueprint that made sense to both technical and non-technical stakeholders</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>3. Prioritized only meaningful events</strong></p>
                <p>Instead of tracking everything, we focused on:</p>
                <ul class="list">
                  <li>Key activation behaviours</li>
                  <li>Engagement loops</li>
                  <li>Revenue-driving moments</li>
                  <li>Retention indicators</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This reduced clutter and significantly improved data interpretability.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="case-detail">
                <h4>Result</h4>
                <p>Once the engineering team implemented the new taxonomy:</p>
                <ul class="list">
                  <li><strong>Internal teams regained confidence in the data</strong></li>
                  <li>Dashboards began reflecting consistent, reliable numbers</li>
                  <li>Product managers and leadership started using analytics actively for decisions</li>
                  <li>Insights, A/B tests, and product planning became smoother and more accurate</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  The team now benefits from a stable, scalable analytics foundation that supports better decisions, without the
                  confusion and noise that previously held them back.
