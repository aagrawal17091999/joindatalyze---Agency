                <h3>Challenge: Low Activation Due to Limited Early Value</h3>
                <p>
                  Although the product attracted new sign-ups, many users were not moving beyond initial onboarding. The
                  <strong>activation rate was low</strong>, and user sessions were short, indicating that users did not experience enough
                  value before being asked to upgrade.
                </p>
                <p>A deep review of the user journey showed two core issues:</p>
                <ol class="list">
                  <li><strong>Value was locked too early behind paywalls</strong>, preventing users from exploring the product meaningfully.</li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>The free-plan limits were too restrictive</strong>, causing users to drop off before forming a habit or understanding the
                    product’s strengths.
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p>This created a barrier between sign-up and activation, resulting in weak engagement metrics.</p>

                <div class="case-detail">
                  <h4>Solution</h4>
                  <p>
                    I conducted a product walkthrough, user-flow audit, and session-level analysis to understand exactly where users dropped off and
                    why. The insights made it clear that users were abandoning the product before reaching its core value moments.
                  </p>
                  <p>We implemented a simple but high-leverage change:</p>
                  <h5>Increased Free Plan Usage Limits</h5>
                  <ul class="list">
                    <li>Expanded what users could do before upgrading</li>
                    <li>Allowed them to test core workflows more thoroughly</li>
                    <li>Created natural “value moments” early in their lifecycle</li>
                    <li>Reduced friction in the journey from sign-up to first meaningful outcome</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    By giving users more room to explore, the product’s value became immediately clearer, increasing the likelihood that they would
                    return and eventually convert.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <div class="case-detail">
                  <h4>Result</h4>
                  <p>The change produced a strong improvement across key metrics:</p>
                  <ul class="list">
                    <li><strong>Activation rate increased by 22%</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Median time spent on the app increased by 2 minutes</strong> (a meaningful gain at early-stage scale)</li>
                  </ul>
                  <div class="case-gallery-inline">
                    <img alt="Stealth activation improvement" class="case-image" src="/images/Stealth.png" />
                  </div>
                  <p>
                    Users now had enough freedom to discover the product’s strengths before committing, resulting in better engagement and stronger
                    early retention.
                  </p>
                </div>
