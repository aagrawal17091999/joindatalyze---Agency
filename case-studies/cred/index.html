                <div class="case-detail">
                  <h4>About CRED</h4>
                  <p>
                    CRED is one of India’s leading FinTech platforms, offering credit card bill payments, rewards, and financial
                    services to over 16 million members. With high transaction volumes and complex payment routing logic,
                    ensuring seamless, reliable, and cost-efficient payments is critical to the platform’s user experience and
                    bottom line.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <div class="case-detail">
                  <h4>Challenge 1: Payment Routing Model</h4>
                  <p>
                    CRED’s payments infrastructure relied on multiple providers, each with varying success rates, latencies, and
                    transaction costs. The team was facing two core issues:
                  </p>
                  <ol class="list">
                    <li><strong>Lower-than-expected payment success rates</strong>, leading to user frustration and increased support load.</li>
                    <li><strong>High routing costs</strong> because payments were not being optimally distributed across providers.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>
                    The existing routing logic could not balance both cost and performance simultaneously, and it also lacked a
                    mechanism to detect provider outages quickly. This created operational inefficiencies and inconsistent user
                    experience during peak transaction windows.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <div class="case-detail">
                  <h4>Solution</h4>
                  <p>We designed a two-part optimization framework that transformed how CRED handled routing decisions.</p>

                  <h5>1. Linear Programming–based Routing Engine</h5>
                  <p>We built a linear optimization model that allowed stakeholders to choose their primary objective:</p>
                  <ul class="list">
                    <li><strong>Maximize success rate</strong>, or</li>
                    <li><strong>Minimize payment processing cost</strong></li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>The model then:</p>
                  <ul class="list">
                    <li>Applied thresholds for the secondary objective (e.g., maintain cost below X, or success rate above Y)</li>
                    <li>Evaluated all possible provider combinations</li>
                    <li>Generated an optimal routing mix that satisfied business constraints and performance goals</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>This gave the team a transparent, data-driven structure for routing decisions.</p>

                  <h5>2. Real-time Provider Outage Detection</h5>
                  <p>To handle unpredictable outages, I developed a real-time model that:</p>
                  <ul class="list">
                    <li>Continuously monitored provider-level success rates</li>
                    <li>Detected sudden drops using statistical thresholds</li>
                    <li>Automatically rerouted payments away from failing providers</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>This drastically improved reliability during live outages and reduced manual intervention.</p>

                </div>

                <div class="case-detail">
                  <h4>Result</h4>
                  <p>The optimization framework delivered significant business impact:</p>
                  <ul class="list">
                    <li><strong>Success rate improved by ~7%</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Payment routing costs decreased by ~12%</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Operational efficiency increased by ~9%</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Provider outages decreased by 93% month-over-month</strong> after introducing the real-time rerouting system</li>
                  </ul>
                  <div class="case-gallery-inline">

                    CRED’s payment infrastructure became more resilient, predictable, and cost-efficient, directly improving user
                    experience at massive scale.

                <div class="case-detail">
                  <h4>Challenge 2: Improving Rent Payment Success Rate</h4>
                  <p>CRED’s rent payment product allowed users to pay rent via credit card. However, success rates were lower than expected because:</p>
                  <ul class="list">
                    <li>Banks frequently declined transactions</li>
                    <li>A subset of users attempted to use the product for <strong>cash-out behavior</strong>, triggering risk controls</li>
                    <li>
                      Users repeatedly retried payments using the <em>same</em> card after failure, even though the card had already shown a low
                      probability of succeeding
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>The team needed a behavioural insight that could meaningfully improve success rates.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="case-detail">
                  <h4>Solution</h4>
                  <p>We performed a detailed analysis of user-level and transaction-level patterns. The key discovery was:</p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>If a user’s first attempt failed, retrying with a different card had a 34% higher success rate than retrying with the same card.</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>This insight was incorporated directly into the product experience:</p>
                  <ul class="list">
                    <li>The payment failure screen was redesigned</li>
                    <li>Users were prompted to try an alternative card instead of retrying the same one</li>
                    <li>Messaging highlighted that using a different card increases the chance of a successful payment</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>This small behavioural change created a large improvement in funnel performance.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="case-detail">
                  <h4>Result</h4>
                  <p>
                    The updated UX and decision logic improved the <strong>rent payment success rate by 3%</strong>, which is a significant lift at
                    CRED’s transaction scale.
                  </p>
                  <p>This translated into:</p>
                  <ul class="list">
                    <li>Fewer frustrated users</li>
                    <li>Higher completed volume</li>
                    <li>Fewer repeated declines and customer support cycles</li>
                  </ul>
