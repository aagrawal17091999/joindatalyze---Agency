<h3>Cost-efficient SMS engagement for a pet training platform</h3>
<div class="case-detail">
<h4>About Petcademy</h4>
<p>Petcademy is a digital pet-training and pet-care education platform that works with shelters, trainers, and pet parents to improve the overall wellbeing of animals. Their engagement strategy relies heavily on SMS campaigns, which deliver personalized training tips, reminders, and behavioural guidance to users. With large-scale messaging volumes, optimizing cost without hurting engagement was a priority.</p>
</div>
<div class="case-detail">
<h4>Challenge: High SMS Costs With Limited Optimization</h4>
<p>Petcademy saw strong engagement from its SMS campaigns, but the associated costs were disproportionately high. The challenge was twofold:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><strong>Reduce SMS spend</strong>, which had become a significant operational cost.</li>
<li><strong>Preserve campaign performance</strong>, ensuring user engagement and completion rates were not negatively affected.</li>
</ul>
<p>The team needed a data-driven approach to optimize messaging without compromising the value users received.</p>
</div>
<div class="case-detail">
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>To identify opportunities for cost reduction, I conducted a detailed performance analysis across all SMS campaigns, reviewing:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Open and click-through behaviour</li>
<li>Engagement patterns by user segments</li>
<li>Message-level contribution to outcomes</li>
<li>Redundancies and low-impact sends</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on this, we implemented two key changes:</p>

<h5>1. Removed Low-Engagement SMS</h5>
<p>We identified specific messages that had consistently low engagement or did not meaningfully contribute to desired actions. By removing or consolidating these, we were able to reduce unnecessary sends while keeping the core campaign intact.</p>

<h5>2. Personalized SMS Content</h5>
<p>We adjusted content and timing based on how users responded to previous messages. This included:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Tailored messaging for active vs inactive users</li>
<li>Behaviour-driven follow-ups</li>
<li>Clearer, more relevant content tied to user needs</li>
</ul>
<p>Personalization ensured that the remaining SMS messages delivered higher value, preventing drop-offs despite reduced volume.</p>
</div>
<div class="case-detail">
<h4>Result</h4>
<p>The optimized campaign strategy delivered measurable improvements:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><strong>12% reduction in SMS costs</strong></li>
<li><strong>Minimal or no decline in user engagement metrics</strong></li>
<li>Improved efficiency with more targeted messaging</li>
</ul>
<p>Petcademy retained the effectiveness of their user communication while significantly cutting operational spend.</p>
