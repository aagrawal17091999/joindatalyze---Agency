                <div class="case-detail">
                  <h4>About zeroone</h4>
                  <p>
                    zeroone is a blockchain-powered social app where users upload, mint, and collect digital artwork. Designed
                    for both creators and collectors, zeroone blends social engagement with crypto-native mechanics, making
                    early activation and repeat usage critical for long-term retention and network growth.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <div class="case-detail">
                  <h4>Challenge 1: Low Artwork Upload Completion After Onboarding</h4>
                  <p>
                    zeroone noticed that although users were completing onboarding, a significant portion dropped off before
                    uploading their first artwork, a key activation milestone. Since the core value of the app is tied to
                    uploading and collecting art, this created:
                  </p>
                  <ul class="list">
                    <li>Low activation rates</li>
                    <li>Weak creator participation</li>
                    <li>Slower social and marketplace interactions</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>The team needed a way to help users reach value faster.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="case-detail">
                  <h4>Solution</h4>
                  <p>After validating that the onboarding flow itself was smooth and not causing friction, we proposed a high-leverage experiment to reshape the early user experience:</p>

                  <h5>1. Encourage artwork uploads during onboarding (optional)</h5>
                  <ul class="list">
                    <li>Added a lightweight prompt during onboarding for users to upload their first piece</li>
                    <li>Keeps the step optional to avoid cognitive overload</li>
                    <li>Increases the chance of completing this action early in the journey</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h5>2. Removed unnecessary onboarding screens</h5>
                  <ul class="list">
                    <li>Streamlined the onboarding flow to reduce friction</li>
                    <li>Helps users reach the app faster and experience value sooner</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h5>3. Enabled collecting even before uploading</h5>
                  <p>Users were given <strong>a few free collection tickets</strong>, allowing them to:</p>
                  <ul class="list">
                    <li>Collect artwork immediately</li>
                    <li>Engage socially before contributing their own work</li>
                    <li>Experience the excitement of the product from day one</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>This gave users a meaningful first interaction that didn’t depend on having artwork ready.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="case-detail">
                  <h4>Result</h4>
                  <p>
                    The experiment delivered strong improvements: <strong>Activation increased from 21% to 55%</strong> and
                    <strong>Week 2 retention increased by 15%</strong>. Providing early value and simplifying onboarding helped
                    users better understand the purpose of the app and stay engaged longer.
                  </p>
                  <div class="case-gallery-inline">

                    />
                  </div>
                </div>

                <div class="case-detail">
                  <h4>Challenge 2: Week 2 Retention Dropped by 26%</h4>
                  <p>
                    zeroone saw a sudden <strong>26% decline in Week 2 retention</strong>, which did not recover organically.
                    The team needed clarity on what caused the drop, which app updates or user segments were most affected, and
                    what actions were needed to restore retention.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Given the community-driven nature of the product, retention dips have compounding effects on engagement and
                    marketplace activity.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <div class="case-detail">
                  <h4>Solution</h4>
                  <p>I performed a multi-layer analysis that included:</p>
                  <ul class="list">
                    <li>Reviewing feature releases leading up to the drop</li>
                    <li>Segmenting users by acquisition channels, device, first-week behaviour, and art actions</li>
                    <li>Analyzing key funnel steps where the drop-off became most pronounced</li>
                    <li>Cross-checking for technical issues or broken user flows</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    This allowed us to identify the precise contributors to the retention decline, enabling the team to focus on
                    the right fixes rather than guessing.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <div class="case-detail">
                  <h4>Result</h4>
                  <p>
                    The engineering and product teams are now implementing the required fixes identified in the analysis. Early
                    internal tests indicate that correcting the issues will restore baseline retention levels and prevent future
                    declines.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <div class="case-detail">
                  <h4>Challenge 3: Low Ongoing Engagement and Lack of Habit Loops</h4>
                  <p>
                    zeroone wanted to make the platform more engaging, fun, and repeat-visit-friendly. Users interacted with the
                    product but did not develop strong habits around daily posting, collecting, or exploring art.
                  </p>
                  <p>The team needed features that:</p>
                  <ul class="list">
                    <li>Encourage users to come back frequently</li>
                    <li>Create a sense of progression</li>
                    <li>Increase social sharing</li>
                    <li>Make the platform feel more alive and competitive</li>
                  </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="case-detail">
                  <h4>Solution</h4>
                  <p>
                    We conducted competitive research across social apps, gaming ecosystems, and Web2.0 engagement loops to
                    identify high-impact mechanics. Based on this analysis, we proposed three features:
                  </p>

                  <h5>1. Streaks</h5>
                  <p>Reward users for daily activity, creating habit loops and a sense of progress.</p>

                  <h5>2. Leaderboards</h5>
                  <p>
                    Introduce friendly competition across creators and collectors, encouraging users to improve their ranking and
                    share achievements.
                  </p>

                  <h5>3. Tiered Rewards</h5>
                  <p>
                    Give users incentives to stay active and unlock exclusive perks based on their engagement level. All three
                    features were designed to reinforce repeat usage and make the app socially sharable, fun, and rewarding.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <div class="case-detail">
                  <h4>Result</h4>
                  <p>
                    After rollout, zeroone saw a measurable lift in user activity: <strong>Engagement increased by 30%</strong>.
                    Users frequently shared streak milestones and leaderboard positions, and collecting and posting activity
                    became more consistent.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These features created the habit loops the product was missing, transforming zeroone into a more dynamic and
                    interactive platform.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <div class="case-detail">
                  <h4>Challenge 4: New App Launch With No Tracking in Place</h4>
                  <p>
                    As zeroone prepared to roll out a completely rebuilt app, the team needed a clean, comprehensive tracking
                    plan with clear definitions for events and properties. They also needed a structure that would help measure
                    onboarding, engagement, creations, collections, and social loops, and a way to ensure new features could be
                    analyzed immediately after launch.
                  </p>
                  <p>Without proper tracking, the team would be flying blind during one of the most critical phases of the product’s life cycle.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="case-detail">
                  <h4>Solution</h4>
                  <p>To support the relaunch, we conducted a full product walkthrough and mapped out every meaningful user interaction. This included:</p>

                  <h5>1. Deep-dive into the new app flows</h5>
                  <ul class="list">
                    <li>Identified core journeys such as onboarding, uploading artwork, collecting, social actions, wallets, and profile setup</li>
                    <li>Documented edge cases and hidden paths to ensure nothing was missed</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h5>2. Built a complete tracking plan</h5>
                  <p>The tracking plan covered:</p>
                  <ul class="list">
                    <li><strong>Event definitions</strong> for key actions</li>
                    <li><strong>Properties</strong> needed to segment and understand behaviour</li>
                    <li><strong>Standardized naming conventions</strong> for consistency</li>
                    <li><strong>Conversion funnels</strong> tied to activation and retention metrics</li>
                    <li><strong>Feature-specific tracking</strong> for new UI/UX elements introduced in the revamp</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h5>3. Created implementation guidelines</h5>
                  <p>So the engineering team could integrate tracking easily and accurately from day one.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="case-detail">
                  <h4>Result</h4>
                  <p>
                    The tracking plan is now with the development team and is being fully implemented across the new app. Once
                    live, zeroone will have complete visibility into user behaviour, the ability to measure the impact of the
                    redesign, and clean, structured data for insights, experiments, and growth strategy. This foundation will
                    allow the team to iterate faster and make data-driven decisions immediately after launch.
